# Dice-Game
A two player minigame where you each roll dice to gain or lose points. 

Use test1 and test2 for the username and 1234 for the password

Rules
1. You will role two 6-sided dices, your rolled total will be added to your score
2. If your rolled total is an even number: +10 additional points to your score
3. If your rolled total is an odd number: -5 points to your score
4. If you roll a double, roll one extra die: your rolled total is added to your score, rules 2, 3 don't apply
5. Your score cannot go below 0
6. You take turns for 5 rounds, the person with the highest score at the end wins
7. If both users have the same score at the end of the 5 rounds, deathmatch occurs: keep rolling until someone gets a higher total score 
8. Winner's score is updated onto the scoreboard

ps. I'm so proud of the dice face display function!
